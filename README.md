# Data-Analysis-in-Python-Video-Game-Sales-with-Ratings-
## Exploratory data analysis and conclusions on video game sales and their ratings across different countries.

In the 1980s, video games became a popular form of entertainment and since then, the industry has grown exponentially in terms of overall revenue generated, user base, number of developers, and quantity of titles to play. The video game industry as of 2022 is a multi-billion-dollar industry, and its sales come from both physical and digital copies of the games.

This project aims to analyze the sales and ratings of video games, in order to better understand the trends and patterns within the industry. The data analyzed comes from Kaggle, and is titled "Video Game Sales with Ratings".

## The Data
The dataset consists of video game titles with over 100,000 sales and was originally generated from a web scrape of VGChartz. The data includes information such as the game title, platform, year of release, global sales, critic score, and user score. In total there are 16 variables and 16,719 rows, with 11,563 of the titles being unique.

## Exploratory Data Analysis 
In order to better understand the data and identify patterns and trends, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was conducted. EDA includes summary statistics, data visualization, and other techniques to better understand the data. Here are some examples:

## Conclusion
This project aimed to analyze the sales and ratings of video games so we could better understand the trends and patterns within the industry. Through the process of Exploratory Data Analysis, we made some interesting findings. For example, it was found that video games are most popular in North America, that action games are the most common type of game, and that there is little to no correlation between the year a game is released and the sales number for games globally among other findings in our Analysis and Findngs section.
